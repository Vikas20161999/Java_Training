Psuedocode for bubble sort algorithm

function bubbleSort(arr: array of integers) -> array of integers
    n = length of arr
    for i from 0 to n - 1
    for j from 0 to n - i - 1
    if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]
    swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
    return arr


Dry run to demonstrate bubble sort 

the array is [5, 3, 8, 1, 4]:

After the first pass:
[3, 5, 1, 4, 8]
[3, 1, 4, 5, 8]
After the second pass:
[1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
The array is now sorted.
